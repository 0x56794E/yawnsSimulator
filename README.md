###C++ impl of YAWNS simulator.


## Notes Graph Loader ##

# Link model:
- Part of graph data for each proc is pre-generated in python => must do this before start the sim
- This is to avoi out of mem error since the num of links can be very large
- Links know of their neighbors via the node they share

# Node model:
- Graph data for each proc is loaded in setup phase
